# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports, ideas and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SV7DAE9) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the arigato.js codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup
To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **master** branch
2. Run `yarn install --dev`
4. Code your heart out!
5. Run `yarn lint` to run ESLint and ensure any JSDoc changes are valid
6. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/PassTheWessel/arigato.js/compare)
